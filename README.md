## General info
In US alone, around 7500 yearly cases of mushrooms poisoning are reported [(Source)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00275514.2018.1479561). According to the source, "misidentification of edible mushroom species appears to be the most common cause and may be preventable through education". 

The goal of this project is to try to create a machine learning model, that can recognize mushroom types. This type of model could help people make the right choice when mushroom picking.
